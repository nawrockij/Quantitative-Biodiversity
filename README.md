**Short Bio:**
I'm from Greenwood, Indiana and received my bachelor's in Biology from the University of Indianapolis. I am currently in my second (and last!) year at SPEA for my MS in environmental science. I hope to work in wildlife biology, practicing conservation and endangered species management, possibly moving on to a PhD in the future. I love nature, especially bird-watching and hiking with my friends/family. I also play the piano, lead the music at my home church, and enjoy painting. :)
